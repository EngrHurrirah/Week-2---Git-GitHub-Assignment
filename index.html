            <ul>
                <li>Explain Git concepts in your own words (as if teaching someone new).</li>
                <li>Connect at least one Git concept with a real-world debugging scenario.
                    <small>(e.g., “If an application suddenly stops connecting to the database, I can use
                       <code>git log</code> to
                        see if someone recently changed the configuration file.”)</small>
                </li>
                <li>Write 8–10 lines in simple language, add screenshots if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="placeholder">[I learned that Git is like a “time machine” for code. A repository is the main folder where all project files and their history are saved. When we make changes, Git shows the status of files – whether they are new, modified, or already saved. Before saving permanently, we put files in the staging area (like packing items in a box before sealing it). A commit is like taking a snapshot of the project at that moment. Using git log, we can go back and see who changed what and when. Branches are like separate roads where different features can be built without disturbing the main road (main branch). Later, we can merge the branch back into the main one.

	    <li> 👉 Real-world example: If a web app suddenly fails to connect to the database, I can use git log to check the recent commits and see if someone changed the database settings in the code. This helps me quickly find the mistake without guessing]  <li>  </p>
