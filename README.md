## 🎯 Learning Objective

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand **basic Git concepts** in your own words.
- Learn to think like a **DevOps/Cloud Engineer**, who may not fix application code but must often:
  - Read logs,
  - Check commit history,
  - Identify configuration changes,
  - Debug issues using Git.

## ✅ Example

> *“If an application fails to connect to the database, I can check `git log` to see who last modified the configuration file and when. This helps me debug without touching the actual code.”*
